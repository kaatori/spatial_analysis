# spatial_analysis
This is for me to experiment with ArcGIS spatial analysis tools in Python. 

My first introduction to ArcGIS was through learning how to use Esri's StoryMaps. This led me into learning more about using spatial data as part of an analysis project. 

Although StoryMaps is primarily a content delivery system for illustrating narratives with maps, it was fun to learn and it got me into using ArcGIS Online to create my own map layers. You can view the StoryMap I made here: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/bcf1f16545284c978f65955be56a0431
